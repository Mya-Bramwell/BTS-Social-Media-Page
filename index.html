Get to know more about the K-pop sensation: BTS! BTS, also known as the Bangtan Boys, is a seven-member, South Korean boy band that debuted on June 13, 2013 with their title track<a href=" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBG5L7UsUxA">"No More Dream"</a> under Big Hit Entertainment. They have broken countless records and are currently the biggest boy group in the world! After debuting in 2013 with their single album, 2 Cool 4 Skool, BTS released their first Korean-language studio album<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_%26_Wild">"Dark & Wild"</a>, and Japanese-language studio album, "Wake Up", in 2014. The group's second Korean studio album,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wings_(BTS_album)">"Wings"</a> (2016), was their first to sell one million copies in South Korea. In 2020, BTS became the first all-South Korean act to reach number one on the Billboard Global 200 and US Billboard Hot 100 with their single "Dynamite" and remix of "Savage Love (Laxed – Siren Beat)" and, with the release of "Life Goes On", became the first group to have two number one debuts on the Hot 100. They are also the first Korean act to get nominated for a Grammy with their smash hit "Dynamite"! These are only some of the endless achievements the group has accomplished and it's only the beginning!
